# Workshop1

Task 1 – Using Node and NPM 
 
Using your own laptop: 
-  Follow the lecture slides and install Node.js 
 
Using a lab Desktop: 
-  Node.js and NPM is already installed on the lab computers. 
 
When Node.js is installed create your week 1 folder and open that folder in your IDE. (Visual 
Studio Code) In your terminal or command prompt, initialise your Node.js project with npm 
init. This will generate a package.json file. 
 
Call your project helloworld. After setting the initial package, create an index.js file and 
write to the console log outputting “Hello World, Node.js!” 
 
 
 
Task 2 – Working with Arrays 
 
Create and indexed array of 5 numbers 
Output the array to the console. 
 
Add a number to the end of the array  (push) 
Output the array to the console 
 
Add a number to the beginning of the array (unshift) 
Output the array to the console 
 
Add an item after the 3 rd  item in the array (splice) 
Output the array to the console 
 
Remove the last number from the array (pop) 
Output the array to the console 
 
Remove the 2nd number from the array (splice) 
Output the array to the console 
 
Edit the 5 th  element in the array to have a value of 100 
Output the array to the console 
 
Sort the array in ascending order (smallest to biggest) (sort) 
Output the array to the console 
 
Task 3 – Working with JSON 
 
Create a javascript object with a key of people and a value that is an array of 3 objects each 
with a  firstname and lastname. 
 
Output the object to the console 
 
Convert that object to a JSON string (stingify) 
Output the string to the console. 
 
Convert the JSON string back into a javascript object (parse) 
Output the object to the console. 
 
 
Task 4 – NPM packages 
 
Let’s play around with some other npm packages. 
 
https://www.npmjs.com/package/array-add-num 
 
Follow the installation and usage  documentation and use this package in your index.js file. 
 
Output the sum of numbers in the following array  [5,4,3,8] 
 
Output should look like “Sum of Array is ??” 
 
Output to the console the value of the array-add-num dependency that you see in your 
package.json file. 
 
Task 5 – Arrow Functions 

Convert the following declarative function to a function expression and then convert the 
function expression to use arrow syntax.  Demonstrate each version in use by outputting a 
result to the console log for each function. 
 
function multiplyNums(x, y, z){ 
 
return “new number is “ + x * y * z;  
}
